## Example HW model implementation and arduino sketch

These example files show how to implemenent an app_timer hardware model for the
Arduino UNO platform, using the TIMER1 peripheral. An example arduino sketch is also
provided, which shows how to implement the classic "blinky" sketch using an app_timer
instead of blocking delays.
